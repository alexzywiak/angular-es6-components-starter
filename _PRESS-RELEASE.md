## Summary ##
  > Works out of the box as a basic project manage application but grows with you and your team.

## Problem ##
  > Project management software often inundates you with options and possible configurations. This promises power but usually delivers confusion. We believe that project management software that's difficult to use hinders more than helps your team. 

## Solution ##
  > doozy keeps it simple. It lets you add details exactly where you want them with its simple and intuitive interface. It removes the organizational obstacles that stand between your team and its goals. It helps you do the tasks that need to get done without the extraneous stuff.
